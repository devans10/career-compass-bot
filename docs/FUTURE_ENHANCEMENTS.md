# Future Enhancements

- Expand storage to include dedicated Goals, Competencies, and GoalMappings tabs so entries can be linked to growth objectives.
- Add goal/competency management commands (e.g., `/goal_add`, `/goal_list`, `/goal_status`, `/goal_link`, `/goals_summary`) to create, track, and review progress.
- Allow logging commands (`/log`, `/task`, `/idea`) to tag entries with goal or competency references (e.g., `#goal:<id>`, `#comp:<name>`) for richer summaries.
- Surface goal/competency context in retrieval flows (`/week`, `/month`) and provide summaries by goal to highlight momentum and gaps.
- Extend testing, documentation, and onboarding materials to cover goal/competency workflows and Google Sheets setup steps.
