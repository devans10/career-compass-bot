# Future Enhancements

- Extend AI usage into guided self-evaluation drafting that weaves in
  goal/competency context and recommended talking points.
- Resume upload/import to seed skill history, auto-tag accomplishments, and
  surface update suggestions when skills drift.
- Provide coaching insights (trends, streaks, gaps) and personalized
  recommendations for skill enhancement, including study paths and certification
  ideas.
- Deliver richer dashboards (goal burndown, milestone burn-up, tag frequency) as
  exported sheets or shareable images.
- Expand reminder engine with smart nudge cadence (streak-based, inactivity
  detection) and per-goal notification preferences.
- Support bulk import/export utilities to seed historical accomplishments,
  goals, and competencies without manual data entry.
- Offer optional webhook mode for Telegram to reduce polling latency and fit
  serverless deployments.
