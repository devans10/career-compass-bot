# Future Enhancements

- Add AI-powered summarization for `/week` and `/month`, plus guided
  self-evaluation drafts that weave in goal/competency context.
- Provide coaching insights (trends, streaks, gaps) and personalized suggestions
  for strengthening weaker competencies.
- Deliver richer dashboards (goal burndown, milestone burn-up, tag frequency) as
  exported sheets or shareable images.
- Expand reminder engine with smart nudge cadence (streak-based, inactivity
  detection) and per-goal notification preferences.
- Support bulk import/export utilities to seed historical accomplishments, goals,
  and competencies without manual data entry.
- Offer optional webhook mode for Telegram to reduce polling latency and fit
  serverless deployments.
